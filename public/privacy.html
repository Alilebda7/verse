    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: February 7, 2026</p>

    <p>
      At Verse, accessible from our website, one of our main priorities is the
      privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document contains types of
      information that is collected and recorded by Verse and how we use it.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We only collect information that is necessary for the core functionality
      of the application. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Local Storage:</strong> We use browser local storage to save
        your preferences, such as your selected language (English or Arabic),
        theme (Light or Dark), and your last read progress. This data stays on
        your device and is not sent to our servers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may use third-party tools to count daily
        listeners. These services may log your IP address temporarily to prevent
        duplicate counting, but we do not store personal identification
        information.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect in various ways, including to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide, operate, and maintain our website</li>
      <li>Improve, personalize, and expand our website</li>
      <li>Understand and analyze how you use our website</li>
      <li>Remember your reading progress for a better experience</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      Like any other website, Verse uses 'cookies'. These cookies are used to
      store information including visitors' preferences, and the pages on the
      website that the visitor accessed or visited. The information is used to
      optimize the users' experience by customizing our web page content based
      on visitors' browser type and/or other information.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Our application uses third-party APIs (such as the Al Quran Cloud API and
      IPify) to fetch Quranic data and determine general location for prayer
      times. These services have their own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>5. GDPR Data Protection Rights</h2>
    <p>
      We would like to make sure you are fully aware of all of your data
      protection rights. Every user is entitled to the following:

        personal data.

        correct any information you believe is inaccurate.

        personal data, under certain conditions.
